Langfuse supports all kinds of identity providers:

- Google (with optional domain restrictions)
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Azure AD/Entra ID
- Okta
- Auth0
- AWS Cognito
- Custom OAuth providers

Thank you to [@RTae](https://github.com/RTae) and [@jay0129](https://github.com/jay0129) for adding support for **Keycloak** and **GitHub Enterprise**!

If you need a specific additional identity provider, please let us know by [creating an issue on GitHub](/issues). Langfuse uses Next-Auth.js, which integrates with [many providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/).

## Get Started

On Langfuse Cloud, please reach out to [support](/support) to configure a custom SSO identity provider for your domain.

When self-hosting Langfuse, see our [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/self-host#sso) for setup instructions.
