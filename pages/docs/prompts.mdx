# Prompt Management

Use Langfuse to effectively **manage** and **version** your prompts. Langfuse prompt management is basically a **Prompt CMS** (Content Management System).

## How it works

1. **Create/update** prompts via Langfuse API/SDKs or Console.
2. **Use** prompts at runtime, always get the latest version (cached by Langfuse SDKs for low latency).
3. _Optionally_, promote a specific version of a prompt to production or quickly rollback to a previous version.

## Why use prompt management?

Typical benefits of using a CMS apply here:

- Decoupling: deploy new prompts without redeploying your application.
- Non-technical users can create and update prompts via Langfuse Console.
- Quickly rollback to a previous version of a prompt.
- Link prompts to Langfuse Tracing to monitor their performance.
